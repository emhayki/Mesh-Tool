MeshTool is a MATLAB class library designed for advanced mesh manipulation and analysis. It enables users to dynamically modify meshes, such as splitting elements and interpolating node coordinates, making it a valuable tool for computational geometry and finite element analysis.

## Features

- **Dynamic Mesh Modification:** Supports operations like element splitting, allowing for localised mesh refinement.
- **Flexible Coordinate Systems:** Supports multiple coordinate systems (Cartesian, Polar, Spherical).
- **Visualisation:** Includes built-in methods for mesh visualisation, with options to display nodes and element numbering.

## Installation

To use MeshTool, clone this repository or download the `Mesh.m` file into your MATLAB working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emhayki/MeshTool.git
```
